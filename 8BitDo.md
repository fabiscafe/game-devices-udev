## B-Mode
This is the only working mode on Linux. To use it you need to hold "B" **every time** you connect the controller or reboot the PC. Otherwise it'll start in Y-Mode and wont work.

### Steam
B-Mode works with steam-input. It is however **important** that you set up the controller as **Generic Gamepad**
It will ***not*** work if it's set up as X-Box Controller (thats default)
